                    If you have a .nz domain name for personal use, chances are good that your name, email address, home address and phone number are all public on the internet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you register a .nz domain name, you are asked for your contact details, including your address and phone number. What may not have been made clear to you is that those details are not kept private between you and the company you're registering the domain with. Instead, they are published publicly on the internet for anyone to see as part of the domain registry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To check whether your details are public, you can enter your domain name below. If discover you have accidentally made personal information public there's advice on what to do about it below.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How can I check if my details are public?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Enter your domain name here, without the www. at the front (i.e. just stuff.co.nz or similar). This will take you to the Domain Name Commission's website which will show you what details are available for this domain.
                    </p>
                    <form action="" class="form-inline" id="domain-form">
                        <div class="form-group">
                            <label for="domain">Enter your domain name:</label>
                            <input class="form-control" id="domain" type="text" name="domain" placeholder="stuff.co.nz">
                        </div>
                        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Check this domain</button>
                    </form>
                    <h3>What can I do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you have discovered that information you'd rather keep private has been made available, your options are limited. <a href="http://natdudley.com/blog/owning-a-dotnz-domain-safely/">This site has a good rundown of how to own a .nz domain safely</a> but it requires a fair bit of work on your part.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why is this the case?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If it caught you by surprise, you're not the only one. Many of the places that sell .nz domains do not make it very clear that this is occurring. The Domain Name Commission, who run .nz, <a href="https://dnc.org.nz/consultation-whois-review-process">are currently holding a consultation</a>. If you are worried about the way your information is being treated, you should send them a quick note at <a href="mailto:policies@dnc.org.nz">policies@dnc.org.nz</a> stating that you are surprised and concerned to find information you believed to be private is published publicly, it will help them make better rules.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why is this a problem?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many .nz domains are owned by companies. For these, there isn't a privacy problem - the details shown will be those for the company. Personal domains however are often registered by individuals for personal expression - personal blogs, photos etc. While some of these people (perhaps you!) are ok with their address being available, many are posting very personal things. Having  information such as home address or phone number available enables stalking, harassment or abuse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Worse, we suspect many domain owners have no idea this is going on and may have unintentionally disclosed information they'd rather keep private.
                    </p>
                    <h3>I don't mind having my address available</h3>
                    <p>
                        You don't mind having it available <i>right now</i> - either nobody is trying to stalk/harass/abuse you or you're just hard nuts :) Maybe that will change in the future?. More importantly, many New Zealanders are already the subject of harassment and abuse. Those New Zealanders deserve to have equal use of their country's domain. It would be good if you could support them.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why is the information made public like this?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps ironically, the stated purpose is to prevent abuse. Having public contact information is intended to prevent .nz domain holders from hiding behind anonymity to harass others, it is intended to aid companies in enforcing their copyright and trademark rights by being able to notify people who are holding domains they don't have a right to, and it is intended to help prevent the use of the space for scams.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Aren't these good things?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If they were an effective tool for dealing with the issue, perhaps. The problem is that online harassment is not stopped by the inability to register in a given domain, meanwhile the public disclosure of identifiable details harms people who want to legitimately use the space. Scammers simply lie when they register, and legal rights do not require public disclosure in order to be enforceable.
