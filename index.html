                    When you register a .nz domain name, you're asked for your contact details. What may not have been made clear to you is that those details are not kept private between you and the company you're reigstering the domain with. Instead, they are published publicly on the internet for anyone to see as part of the domain registry.

                    If it caught you by surprise, you're not the only one. Many of the places that sell .nz domains do not make it very clear that this is occurring. The Domain Name Commission, who run .nz,
